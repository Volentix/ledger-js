## Install

You must have access to an EOS instance running.

**Config**

In order to run the tests, you will need to first create a `config.json` file. Note that this file will remain on your local machine and never be uploaded into git.

First you need to copy the template file with the following command:

```
cp test/config.json.template test/config.json
```

Then open up a text editor and modify the following values:

| KEY                            | Description                               |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `REPLACE_THE_ID_OF_THE_CHAIN`    | The chain id of your running instance     |
| `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_PROVIDER` | Your key provider                         |
| `REPLACE_WITH_HOST_URL`          | The endpoint of your EOS running instance |

```
